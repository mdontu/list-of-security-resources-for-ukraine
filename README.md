# List of Cybersecurity Resources for Ukraine
This is a dictionary of companies or verified experts offering cybersecurity services, data, or other tangible assets to assist in Ukraine's defense of its independence.

## Notes

This list is split into offers of assistance for individuals (right now, all known offers are focused on keeping journalists safe/secure), offers of assistance to Ukraine+EU organizations, and offers of assistance to non-Ukraine/non-EU organizations.

To make this most effective, this repository will **only** take entities which are making tangible commitments to Ukraine or other countries in need. **No** thoughts & prayers are allowed on this list. Further, entities that provide easy to access services will be placed near the top of their section, and those making a specific commitment to provide services to Ukraine but not detailing how Ukrainians could access those services will be placed near the bottom of their section.
