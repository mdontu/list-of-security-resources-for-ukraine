# List of Cybersecurity Resources for Ukraine
This is a dictionary of companies or verified experts offering cybersecurity services, data, or other tangible assets to assist in Ukraine's defense of its independence. Secondarily, this may also have resources for other NATO entities in responding to the increasing threat of Russia beyond its own borders.

Above all, this is **not** a place for companies to offer "thoughts and prayers" or nontangible support. Ukranian and NATO defenders, this is for you to get connected to relevant services **fast**.

Companies being added to this list will be roughly sorted by the time that the maintainers were made aware the company is offering tangible support to Ukraine. Companies which claim to offer tangible support, but haven't described exactly how companies can obtain that support, will be placed at the bottom.
