# List of Cybersecurity Resources for Ukraine
This is a dictionary of companies or verified experts offering cybersecurity services, data, or other tangible assets to assist in Ukraine's defense of its independence. Secondarily, this may also have resources for other NATO entities in responding to the increasing threat of Russia beyond its own borders.

## Notes

To make this most effective, this list will only take entities which are making tangible commitments to Ukraine or other countries in need. **No** thoughts & prayers are allowed on this list. Further, entities that provide easy to access services will be placed at the top, and those making a specific commitment to provide services to Ukraine but not detailing how Ukrainians could access those services will be placed at the bottom. Perfect ordering is not guaranteed.

To add a resource you've found - either a company or verified expert offering resources to Ukraine, create a [new Issue](https://github.com/r-cybersecurity/list-of-security-resources-for-ukraine/issues/new/choose) and use the provided template to provide the requested information (such as the source of the information, the company name, what services are being provided, etc.). Moderators will validate, add your finding to the list, and close the issue manually. You will need a GitHub account for this.
