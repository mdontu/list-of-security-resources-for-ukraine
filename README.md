# List of Cybersecurity Resources for Ukraine
This is a dictionary of companies or verified experts offering cybersecurity services, data, or other tangible assets to assist in Ukraine's defense of its independence. Secondarily, this may also have resources for other entities in responding to the increasing threat of Russia beyond its own borders.

## Notes

This list is split into offers of assistance for individuals (right now, all known offers are focused on keeping journalists safe/secure), offers of assistance to Ukraine+EU organizations, and offers of assistance to non-Ukraine/non-EU organizations.

To make this most effective, this repository will **only** take entities which are making tangible commitments to Ukraine or other countries in need. **No** thoughts & prayers are allowed on this list. Further, entities that provide easy to access services will be placed near the top of their section, and those making a specific commitment to provide services to Ukraine but not detailing how Ukrainians could access those services will be placed near the bottom of their section.
